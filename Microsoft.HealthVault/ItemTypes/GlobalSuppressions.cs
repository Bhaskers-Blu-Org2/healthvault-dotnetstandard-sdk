// This file lists existing suppressions
// Feel free to delete lines when you fix the underlying issue.
// You should never add to this file; if you must suppress an FxCop warning, put the suppression inline.
// If you absolutely MUST add to this file, you can run 'oacr fxcop <project> /target <assembly>'
// where <project> is HealthVault or HealthVault_SDK and assembly is the dll you're building, including extension.
// This will launch the fxcop gui. Click Analyze, then rightclick the error and select Copy As -> Module level suppression. Paste here.
